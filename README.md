--- MeowMeter ---

-- About -- 

MeowMeter is a simple web application created as part of a 24-hour app conception and development challenge. The challenge aimed to enhance our skills by pushing us to design and build a functional app within a limited timeframe. Our team was presented with a random theme for the project, in this case "kitten rating." The app was made  by  @KTassieand myself (@TabChazelle)

-- Purpose --

The primary goal of MeowMeter was to create a fun and interactive platform where anyone can rate adorable kitten images using various reaction emojis. We wanted to explore rapid prototyping and development techniques while embracing the whimsical theme of kittens.

-- Features --

- Users can view random kitten images.
- Users can express their reactions to the kittens using emoji buttons.
- Real-time reaction counters reflect the popularity of each kitten and in the Top 3 section.
  

-- Development Process --

- Brainstorming: We brainstormed ideas based on the given theme and settled on the concept of a kitten rating app.
- Design: We quickly sketched out the user interface and planned the functionality.
- Development: Using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and Ruby on Rails, we rapidly developed the application's core features.
- Testing: We conducted brief usability tests to ensure functionality and responsiveness.
- Deployment: The app was deployed to a hosting service to make it accessible to users.

-- Conclusion --

MeowMeter was a delightful project born out of a spontaneous challenge. It served as an excellent opportunity for us to hone our development skills while indulging in the joy of kittens. We hope you enjoy using MeowMeter as much as we enjoyed creating it!

Feel free to explore the code !
